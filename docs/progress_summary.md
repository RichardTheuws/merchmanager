## Notes

The core models and services have been implemented, providing the foundation for the plugin's functionality. The next phase will focus on building the user interface components, both for the admin area and the public-facing side of the plugin.

The database structure has been established with tables for sales, stock logs, and stock alerts. The plugin activation, deactivation, and uninstallation processes have been properly configured to handle these database tables.

Meta boxes have been created for all custom post types, allowing for easy management of bands, tours, shows, merchandise, and sales pages through the WordPress admin interface.

The next major task is to implement the admin pages for managing sales, viewing reports, and configuring plugin settings. This will be followed by the public-facing functionality for processing sales and displaying merchandise.
